The Bananium Set is a mod that adds a new ore to the game to help you with the end game. 

"Bananium" can be obtained once the player has at least a pickaxe axe and can be smelted into bars using an Adamantite Forge. 

Please note that the stats of the weapons are subject to change since nothing in this mod is final at the moment. 

Special Thanks to: TunaCat for sprites.

Patch v0.2: 
- Fixed armor set recipes
- Added the requirement to kill the Mech bosses and Plantera in order to use weapons
